<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I added some audio to the game on collection and on death. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I learned a lot from following the tutorial for the snake game. It will take me a lot more practice before I'm at a level to do this type of game for myself.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
The tutorial I followed taught me a lot about js programming and I think the hardest part was understanding how all the different pieces interacted with each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Granny went on a camping trip. After all that campfire food, she is in desperate need for some fiber supplement.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Elderly person
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard, deterministic, joker, snake game
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
My first game was using WASD control, but this one uses arrow keys and you cannot turn directly around only left or right from the direction you are facing.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Have fun collecting fiber supplement for granny. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
I think this game operates like your average snake game, but in future revisions I'd like to add a timer that counts down and different elements that adds time to the timer.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Stay alive as long as possible, and avoid running into yourself when the granny train gets long.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Granny is on a camping trip and the food has taken a toll on her stomach. Collect the fiber supplement! This fiber supplement has some mystic properties and granny starts hallucinating and seeing herself the more fiber supplement she eats. The only way to break the dream is to run into yourself.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone interested in a dumb, sorta funny game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Can be played for as long as the user likes.
</li>
