<h2>Collect things then reload!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
Not much, I just wanted to get the hang of Phaser, and js. 
On my iteration I added background music and also a mechanic that speeds the 
character up as they collect more diamonds. I also added text that displays after 
all the diamonds are collected so that the game has some sort of end state and 
the player can restart to play again. I also added a background space image so that 
the game would look more produced and less janky.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Learning to give control to the player through WASD control was important for me because I've never felt that arrow key movement feels very good in games.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot about Phaser and js, which will help me with future games.
The hardest part was making the character and diamonds overlap and call the function to add points and play the ding.
For whatever reason I still cannot restart the game a legitimate way. I looked at a bunch of different tutorials on how to restart but none of them worked.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I used itch.io for some free assets (such as the sprite and diamonds, and I found the sound clip on YouTube.
The background music was found on itch.io and it is done by Nicole Marie T.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I used the phaser tutorial for a lot of it (I think its called 'My First Game'). There was another Phaser tutorial that helped me with WASD control.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Collect the diamonds and get 1000 points.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I think oasis fits pretty well, the little sprite is floating around in space collecting things. After he collects them all he is able to chill.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The input is keyboard and I would say direct.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
For me its best asset is the WASD control.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I'd like players of this game to be wowed by how incredibly underwhelming someones first game can be.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The gameplay is a simple loop of collecting the randomly generated diamonds that appear on your screen. I couldn't figure it all out but in a perfect world I would have more control over placements of diamonds a fail state and a splash screen for winning.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Collect all the diamonds and then reload for more diamond collecting.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
My character is a lonely dude in space, looking for things to pass the time. While being stranded in space, he has become exceptionally good at collecting the space trash (diamonds) around him.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
I think anyone could play this game, there isn't much too it.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Honestly less than a minute.
</li>
